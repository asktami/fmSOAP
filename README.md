Use FileMaker to make SOAP requests to an API

## Consuming SOAP APIs with FileMaker

Use FileMaker to perform a POST operation on a SOAP API and get an XML response,

The text in the "reqBin SOAP Request" field can be used at [ReqBin](https://reqbin.com/req/c-eanbjsr1/curl-get-xml-example) to POST a SOAP request using cURL.

The text in the "url", "soap_envelope", and "options" fields is used to POST a SOAP request using cURL from FileMaker.

Tested with FileMaker 16 thru 19.
